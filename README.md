# Unsupervised_Machine_Learning

Did you every have a large music playlist containing songs that don't fit together at all? Here is where machine learning can help you.
In this **Unsupervised Machine Learning** project I analyse a dataset of 5000 songs and assign them to playlists based on their musical features. 

The spotify dataset stems from the WBS Coding School website. 
It includes Spotify's official audio features. 
You will find details about those features [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features).

## Tools

My statistical tools are **K-Means Clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis**.

- **Principal component analysis (PCA)** is a powerful technique for analyzing high-dimensional data, such as this dataset of musical features. By reducing the dimensionality of the data, PCA can make it easier to visualize and understand the relationships between the different features. 

- **K-Means clustering** is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to group a dataset of musical features into a predefined number of clusters. Each cluster represents a group of songs that share similar musical characteristics. K-Means clustering can be used to identify different genres of music, or to discover new musical genres that may not have been previously identified. It can also be used to group songs together based on their mood or energy level.

Not yet uploaded is the dataset, which I will provide shortly in a Google Drive repository.

## Context
This Machine Learning project was carried out in the context of a 4.5 month-long Data Science bootcamp with WBS Coding School. 
Many thanks to WBS Coding School and to my instructors for the guidance.
